# Week-9-Project-Honeypot
Submission for week 9 assignment.


Which Honeypot(s) you deployed




Any issues you encountered

The first issue that I encountered was downloading the SDK. When I first installed it, my console outputted an error. I did not understand the error message and was confused for a bit. After researching online and finding no solution, I attempted to retry installing the SDK. This time, I gave a new directory when the console asked for a directory. Fortunately, this time it actually worked. I was able to install the SDK along with the other Google Cloud commands. Afterwards, I tried initializing google cloud on my computer. My attempt worked until I tried setting up a firewall. I realized that I needed to create an account with Google Cloud and set up my billing. After doing so, I started following the rest of the instructions.
